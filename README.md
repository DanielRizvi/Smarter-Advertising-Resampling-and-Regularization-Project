# Smarter-Advertising: Resampling-and-Regularization-Project #CodeDaniel
This is a project that explores the effectiveness of resampling and regularization techniques in enhancing predictive power for advertising data. The project involves analyzing a dataset of advertising data and applying various resampling and regularization techniques to improve the accuracy of a regression model predicting sales.

The dataset used in this project is the Advertising dataset, which includes information on advertising budgets and corresponding sales for a product across various media channels. The goal of the project is to build a regression model that can predict sales based on advertising budgets, and to improve the accuracy of this model using resampling and regularization techniques.
Data: The data used in this project is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv

The project includes the following components:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis: The dataset is analyzed to gain insights into the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
Model building: A linear regression model is built to predict sales based on advertising budgets.
Resampling techniques: Various resampling techniques, such as bootstrap sampling and cross-validation, are applied to the dataset to improve the accuracy of the regression model.
Regularization techniques: Various regularization techniques, such as ridge and lasso regression, are applied to the dataset to improve the accuracy of the regression model.
Model evaluation: The accuracy of the regression model is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared.
The project is implemented using Python and various data analysis and machine learning libraries, such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The code for the project is available in the GitHub repository, along with the dataset and documentation
